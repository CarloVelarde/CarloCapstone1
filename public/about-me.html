    <p> I am an incoming sophmore at the University of Iowa studying Computer Science. All my life I have loved computers
        and I am excited to continue working with computers in ways I would have never imagined. Although I love computers,
        I have other interests as well. I love everything basketball. I grew up in a city where basketball is very competitive. 
        By growing up in such a basetball intense culture, I started playing in first grade. I ended up playing 
        varsity basketball for my high school. Now that I am currently a university student,
        I watch a lot of basketball with my friends and keep up to date with nba news.
